De [1]:
  [...]
  there are plenty of good mathematical problems still waiting to be
  solved, almost everywhere you look—especially in areas of life where
  
  
mathematics has rarely been applied before. Mathematicians can provide
solutions to these problems, receiving a double payoff—namely the pleasure
of working out the mathematics, together with the appreciation of the people
who can use the solutions. So let's go forth and apply mathematics in new
ways.
